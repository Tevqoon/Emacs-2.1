* I want to recreate my flashcard export from org.
Please help me by first thinking where the best place for the use package block in the init file would be.


Based on the structure of your =init.el= file, the best place to add a use-package block for flashcard export would be in the "Org mode" section. This is typically located around the org-mode related configurations, which in your file seems to be around lines 900-1493.

Specifically, I recommend placing it after the org-roam configurations (around line 1493) but before the citation and tag management sections. This keeps related org-mode functionality grouped together and maintains a logical flow in your configuration.

Would you like me to help you draft the use-package block for flashcard export? If so, could you specify which specific flashcard export method or package you're planning to use (e.g., org-drill, anki-mode, etc.)?

*** I've installed it as you can see.
An issue I have right now is that I have a bunch of already extant flashcards which I'd not want pushed and which we can honestly not think of as flashcards anymore. I've added a buffer to context so you can see an example. there's two things to be done.
1. We need to get flashcard tag syncing going again, so that when we remove the flashcard org properties, the flashcard filetags will automatically get disabled
2. find a way to remove the flashcard info from each org-roam file with the #flashcards tag. this is slightly nontrivial because we can neither simply remove all the property drawers (since there might be more stuff in there) nor simply remove all anki properties from the drawers (since they might be the only ones and as such we *should* remove the whole drawer). Please suggest a plan of action.

   

I see the situation now. You have org-roam files with existing flashcard content that needs special handling. Let's tackle this in two parts:

** 1. Flashcard tag syncing

Looking at your =vulpea= configuration, I can see you already have a tag-checking system in place. We need to add a similar mechanism for the =:flashcards:= tag. Let's add a checker that looks for ANKI properties in the buffer.

Here's what we need to do:
1. Add a checker function for flashcard content
2. Add "flashcards" to your =tag-checkers= list

** 2. Removing flashcard info from files

For this task, we need a function that can scan through org-roam files with the #flashcards tag and intelligently remove ANKI-related properties from property drawers without breaking other content.

Let's analyze what we need to do:Let me draft a plan of action:

*** Plan of Action

**** 1. Tag synchronization for flashcards

We need to add a checker function to your =tag-checkers= list that will detect if a file has ANKI-related properties and tag accordingly:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org/has-anki-flashcards-p ()
  "Return non-nil if current buffer has ANKI-related properties."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (re-search-forward ":ANKI_\\(NOTE_TYPE\\|DECK\\|NOTE_ID\\|TAGS\\):" nil t)))

;; Add to tag-checkers list
(setq tag-checkers '(("project" . org/project-p)
                     ("flashcards" . org/has-anki-flashcards-p)))
#+end_src

**** 2. Removing flashcard info from files

I'll create a function that will:
1. Find all files with the =flashcards= tag
2. For each file, scan through property drawers
3. Remove ANKI properties while preserving other properties
4. Remove empty drawers
5. Optionally save the file

** I've done part 1. Continue with making such a function.


Great! Let's create the function to remove Anki flashcard information from files. Here's a comprehensive solution:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun org-remove-anki-properties ()
  "Remove ANKI-related properties from all org-roam files with the flashcards tag.
This function will:
1. Find all files with the flashcards tag
2. For each file, scan through property drawers
3. Remove ANKI properties while preserving other properties
4. Remove empty drawers
5. Save the file if changes were made"
  (interactive)
  (let ((files (org-flashcards-files))
        (count 0))
    (dolist (file files)
      (message "Processing file %s" file)
      (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file)
        (let ((modified nil))

           (while (re-search-forward ":PROPERTIES:" nil t)

                                  (point)))
                    (contents (buffer-substring drawer-begin drawer-end))
                    (new-contents (replace-regexp-in-string

                                   contents)))
               
               ;; If we've modified the contents
               (when (not (string= contents new-contents))
                 (setq modified t)

                 (if (string-match-p "^:PROPERTIES:\n[ \t]*:END:$" 
                                    (string-trim new-contents))
                     ;; If empty, delete the whole drawer
                     (delete-region drawer-begin drawer-end)
                   ;; Otherwise replace with new content
                   (delete-region drawer-begin drawer-end)
                   (goto-char drawer-begin)
                   (insert new-contents))))))
          
          ;; Look for and remove ANKI_NOTE_TYPE/DECK/etc. headlines with Back/Front subheads
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (while (re-search-forward "^\\*+ .*\n[ \t]*:PROPERTIES:\n.*:ANKI_NOTE_TYPE:" nil t)

                                       (progn (backward-char) (point))
                                     (point-max)))))
              ;; Check if this is an Anki headline with Front/Back subheads
              (save-excursion

                  (setq modified t)
                  (delete-region headline-start next-headline))
                (widen))))
          
          ;; Save if modified
          (when modified
            (setq count (1+ count))
            (save-buffer))
          (kill-buffer))))
    (message "Removed Anki properties from %d files" count)))
#+end_src

This function will:

1. Get all files with the flashcards tag using your =org-flashcards-files= function
2. Process each file to:
   - Remove ANKI properties from property drawers
   - Remove empty drawers (those that only contained ANKI properties)
   - Detect and remove entire Anki flashcard structures (headings with ANKI properties and Front/Back/Hint subheadings)
3. Save modified files and report how many files were changed

You can run this with =M-x org-remove-anki-properties=.

Would you like any modifications to this function before implementing it?

**** Abstract the function into two parts - one that handles the current buffer and one that runs it on all the flashcards cards. Additionally, give the affected buffers a new tag which will signify they used to have flashcards in case I want to resurrect them in the future.


Great idea! Here's the refactored solution with two functions and the addition of an "ex-flashcards" tag for affected files:

#+begin_src elisp

                             "^[ \t]*:ANKI_[^:]+:.*\n" 
                             ""

             (delete-region headline-start next-headline))
           (widen)))))
    
    ;; If changes were made, add ex-flashcards tag
    (when modified
      (when (fboundp 'vulpea-buffer-tags-get)
        (let* ((tags (vulpea-buffer-tags-get))
               (updated-tags (cons "ex-flashcards" (remove "flashcards" tags))))
          (apply #'vulpea-buffer-tags-set updated-tags))))
    
    modified))

(defun org-remove-anki-properties-all ()
  "Remove ANKI-related properties from all org-roam files with the flashcards tag.

  (interactive)
  (let ((files (org-flashcards-files))

          (save-buffer))
        (kill-buffer)))
    (message "Removed Anki properties from %d files" count)))
#+end_src

This solution:

1. Separates the functionality into two functions:
   - =org-remove-anki-properties-buffer=: Works on current buffer and returns whether changes were made
   - =org-remove-anki-properties-all=: Processes all files with the flashcards tag

2. When changes are made, it:
   - Removes the "flashcards" tag
   - Adds an "ex-flashcards" tag for historical reference
   - Preserves all other tags

3. Both functions maintain the same careful property drawer handling to avoid removing non-Anki content.

You can run the buffer version with =M-x org-remove-anki-properties-buffer= when in a specific file, or use =M-x org-remove-anki-properties-all= to process all flashcard files.

* I'm now trying to set up an automated way to keep track of which files have had flashcard changes.
:PROPERTIES:
:GPTEL_TOPIC: Automated flashcard changes
:END:
I've already brainstormed a way to do that - through slightly improving vulpea by adding hooks that happen before and after a tag update, i.e. when a file gains or loses a tag, something like this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Define hook variables
(defvar tags/tag-added-hook nil
  "Hook run when a tag is added to a file.
Each function is called with two arguments: the tag and the buffer.")

(defvar tags/tag-removed-hook nil
  "Hook run when a tag is removed from a file.
Each function is called with two arguments: the tag and the buffer.")

;; Modify tags/org-update-tag to run hooks when tags change
(defun tags/org-update-tag (tcpair)
  "Update \\='(tag . checker) tag in the current buffer."
  (when (and (not (member (buffer-name) prune/ignored-files))
             (not (active-minibuffer-window))
             (vulpea-buffer-p))
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (let* ((tag-name (car tcpair))
             (tags (vulpea-buffer-tags-get))
             (original-tags tags)
             (had-tag (member tag-name tags)))
        
        ;; Run checker and modify tags
        (if (funcall (cdr tcpair))
            (setq tags (cons tag-name tags))
          (setq tags (remove tag-name tags)))
        
        ;; Cleanup duplicates
        (setq tags (seq-uniq tags))
        
        ;; Update tags if changed
        (when (or (seq-difference tags original-tags)
                  (seq-difference original-tags tags))
          (apply #'vulpea-buffer-tags-set tags)
          
          ;; Run appropriate hooks

             ;; Tag was added

#+end_src

This combined with a queue of which anki cards to push (or rather, which files that have changes anki files to push) seems to me to be a good way to handle things. Give me what to implement regarding our anki config for this.
Notes:
1. it'll probably suffice to have a list, not a set, of files to be pushed
2. i don't want automatic pushing, just tracking of what is to be pushed.
3. the queue should be automatically written and read from a file on every update, so that it remains even if emacs is killed. 


I'll help you set up a tracking system for files with flashcard changes. Looking at your configuration, I see you're using anki-editor and have a tag checker for "flashcards" that uses the =org/has-anki-flashcards-p= function.

Let's implement a solution to track files with flashcard changes:Based on your requirements, here's what we need to implement:

1. A queue (list) of files that have flashcard changes
2. Functions to add/remove files from this queue
3. Hook functions that track when flashcard tags are added/removed
4. Functions to save/load the queue from a file
5. Integration with your tag hooks

Here's the implementation I recommend:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Define the queue and related functions
(defvar anki-flashcard-queue nil
  "List of files with flashcard changes that need to be pushed to Anki.")

(defvar anki-flashcard-queue-file
  (expand-file-name "anki-flashcard-queue.el" user-emacs-directory)
  "File to save the flashcard queue between Emacs sessions.")

(defun anki-flashcard-queue-add (file)
  "Add FILE to the flashcard queue if not already present."
  (let ((absolute-file (expand-file-name file)))
    (unless (member absolute-file anki-flashcard-queue)
      (push absolute-file anki-flashcard-queue)
      (anki-flashcard-queue-save))))

(defun anki-flashcard-queue-remove (file)
  "Remove FILE from the flashcard queue."
  (let ((absolute-file (expand-file-name file)))
    (when (member absolute-file anki-flashcard-queue)
      (setq anki-flashcard-queue (delete absolute-file anki-flashcard-queue))
      (anki-flashcard-queue-save))))

(defun anki-flashcard-queue-save ()
  "Save the flashcard queue to a file."
  (with-temp-file anki-flashcard-queue-file
    (insert ";; Anki flashcard queue - DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY\n")
    (insert ";; This file is auto-generated by Emacs\n\n")
    (insert "(setq anki-flashcard-queue\n")
    (insert "  '(\n")
    (dolist (file anki-flashcard-queue)
      (insert (format "    %S\n" file)))
    (insert "  ))\n")))

(defun anki-flashcard-queue-load ()
  "Load the flashcard queue from a file."
  (when (file-exists-p anki-flashcard-queue-file)
    (load-file anki-flashcard-queue-file)))

;; Load the queue on startup
(anki-flashcard-queue-load)

;; Hook functions for tracking flashcard changes
(defun anki-flashcard-tag-added (tag buffer)
  "Add file to the flashcard queue when TAG is added to BUFFER."
  (when (string= tag "flashcards")
    (when-let ((file (buffer-file-name buffer)))
      (anki-flashcard-queue-add file))))

(defun anki-flashcard-tag-removed (tag buffer)
  "Update flashcard queue when TAG is removed from BUFFER.
This function does NOT remove files from the queue as they might
still have pending changes to push."
  ;; We don't remove from queue when tag is removed, as user might want
  ;; to push the deletion to Anki. They should manually clear the queue
  ;; after pushing changes.
  nil)

;; Add hook functions to the tag hooks
(add-hook 'tags/tag-added-hook #'anki-flashcard-tag-added)
(add-hook 'tags/tag-removed-hook #'anki-flashcard-tag-removed)

;; Utility functions for managing the queue
(defun anki-flashcard-queue-display ()
  "Display the current flashcard queue."
  (interactive)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Anki Flashcard Queue*")
    (erase-buffer)
    (insert "Files with flashcard changes pending to be pushed to Anki:\n\n")
    (if anki-flashcard-queue
        (dolist (file anki-flashcard-queue)
          (insert (format "- %s\n" file)))
      (insert "No files in queue.\n"))
    (special-mode)
    (display-buffer (current-buffer))))

(defun anki-flashcard-queue-clear ()
  "Clear the flashcard queue after pushing changes to Anki."
  (interactive)
  (when (yes-or-no-p "Clear the entire Anki flashcard queue? ")
    (setq anki-flashcard-queue nil)
    (anki-flashcard-queue-save)
    (message "Anki flashcard queue cleared")))

(defun anki-flashcard-queue-remove-current ()
  "Remove current file from the flashcard queue."
  (interactive)
  (if-let ((file (buffer-file-name)))
      (progn
        (anki-flashcard-queue-remove file)
        (message "Removed current file from Anki flashcard queue"))
    (message "Not visiting a file")))
#+end_src

You can add this code to your configuration, ideally after your vulpea and anki-editor configuration. This implementation:

1. Creates a persistent queue of files with flashcard changes
2. Automatically adds files to the queue when the "flashcards" tag is added
3. Saves the queue to a file so it persists between Emacs sessions
4. Provides utility functions to view, clear, and manage the queue

You can then create keybindings for the interactive functions like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a q") #'anki-flashcard-queue-display)  ; Show queue
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a c") #'anki-flashcard-queue-clear)    ; Clear queue
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c a r") #'anki-flashcard-queue-remove-current) ; Remove current file
#+end_src

This setup meets your requirements by:
1. Using a simple list to track files with changes
2. Not pushing changes automatically - that's still manual
3. Persisting the queue between Emacs sessions by saving to a file

Would you like me to modify or extend any part of this implementation?
